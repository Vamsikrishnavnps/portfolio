								<span class="image main"><center><img src="images/thumbs/Project_2_0.jpg.png.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></center></span>
								<p>With a growing trend in consumption and a stark trend in the production of plant/crop-based food in
									India, the Agro-industry is in desperate need of restructuring the process of harvesting edible
									crops/plants. This project aims on developing a device/system that performs the important task of
									acquiring crucial data that determines if a plant is infected by analyzing the image of the leaf of a
									plant. This process is to be carried out by an AGV that is capable of navigating itself through a
									contained environment, and providing real-time big data to a farmer so he or she can take
									precautious action to protect his/her plants/crops. The project also involves integrating a 3-DOF
									robotic arm that is mounted on the AGV body. The arm's primary function is to guide the imagecapturing
									device to a leaf, but apart from that, the arm is also modular thereby giving us a chance to
									increase its functionality. Such a device would provide a farmer with much-needed analytics and
									decrease the laborious task of inspection.</p>

								<p> primary objective of this project is to build a device that is partially self-sufficient and
									capable of acquiring some crucial data from plants/crops. A device as stated above could
									help in minimising laborious inspection tasks and could help in increasing quality and yield
									of said plants/crops. Keeping this in mind certain sub-goals are set to design this system.
									First is to build a land based AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) which is partially selfsufficient,
									i.e., capable of analysing its surroundings and navigating itself through an
									undefined environment. Second is to build an Automated Image Capturing System capable
									of capturing, analysing and providing a conclusion based on the input. This system will
									primarily detect diseases on a leaf. Third is to build a Robotic Arm which solves the primary
									purpose of housing the Camera and guiding the camera to acquire accurate images. An
									effort will also be made to make this arm modular thereby increasing its functionality. On
									the whole this project primarily focuses on acquiring and analysing critical data thereby
									providing useful information to farmers</p>

								<p>Among the top 30 list of causes of death on the planet, fire is in 27 th place. During 2017, the world's highest fire deaths per year were in Ivory Coast. The US had a fire death rate of 0.73 per 100,000 people in the same year. Property losses accounted for a whopping 25.6 billion dollars due to fire in 2018. Of those fires, 30% were residential while 50.7% of the home fires started in the kitchen. is in</p>
								<span class="image main"><center><a href="images/thumbs/Project_3_0.JPG"><img src="images/thumbs/Project_3_0.JPG" alt="" /></a></center></span>
								<p>According to the National Fire Protection Association, although the number of fire-related deaths has decreased by 42% since 1980, the total number of civilian fire deaths is 8.6% higher than what it was in 2020.</p>
								<p>Even though the fire death statistics are looking better each year, the accidents and fatalities remain real and horrifying, this motivated us to find a solution to increase the efficiency of the firefighters as well as the residents when it comes to tackling this situation. SMART FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM, a compact prototype consisting of temperature (LM35) and smoke (MQ135) sensors was therefore designed. A piezoelectric buzzer and a varying-pressure water sprinkler are utilized to alert the residents during the fire. In this model, the temperature and presence of hazardous gases would be monitored regularly and the actuators built would be triggered when it hits the threshold points of the respective parameters. Firefighters arriving at the incident would have a clearer picture to analyze the situation and do the necessary while also allowing the residents to be alerted at the earliest times for them to exit the area.</p>

Using 2 LEDs, green and red, the situation should be indicated. When in threat the red LED must illuminate, followed by a buzzer and the LCD display must display the state and further process is initiated. A safe environment must be actuated by actuators controlled by servomotor that is dependent on the threat level. It should exert low pressure for low threat and high pressure for high threat. The process halts when green LED turns ON.</p>

								<span class="image main"><center><img src="images/thumbs/project_4.JPG" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></center></span>
								<p>A self-balancing biped wheeled robot is a type of robot that is able to balance on two wheels and
									move around using two legs. This type of robot is able to combine the stability of a wheeled
									platform with the ability to navigate rough or uneven terrain using its legs.</p>
								<p>To achieve self-balancing, a biped wheeled robot typically uses a combination of sensors, such as
									gyroscopes and accelerometers, and motors or actuators to control its movement and balance.
									The robot's onboard control system processes sensor data to determine its orientation and
									movement, and adjusts the position of its legs and wheels accordingly.</p>
								<p>Self-balancing biped wheeled robots have a number of potential applications, including
									transportation, search and rescue, and entertainment. They can be used as a platform for
									exploring control algorithms and demonstrating the capabilities of sensors and other hardware.</p>
								<p>The team of 5 members aims to simulate a self balancing biped wheeled robot for transportation
									on rough terrain for our Simulation tools final project. Self-balancing biped robots are a type of
									robot that are designed to move and navigate on two legs while maintaining their balance. These
									robots have the potential to be used in a variety of applications, including search and rescue
									operations, military operations, and even personal transportation.

								<h3 class="major">Project Statement</h3>
								<div>
								<p>A self-balancing biped robot for transportation is a robot that is designed to move over uneven or
									rough surfaces while maintaining its balance. There are several challenges associated with
									designing and building a self-balancing biped robot for transportation. There are several
									challenges associated with designing and implementing self-balancing robots:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Sensing and control: Self-balancing robots rely on sensors to measure their orientation
											and motion, and control algorithms to adjust their position and balance accordingly. This
											can be a complex task, especially if the robot is required to operate in a dynamic or
											uncertain environment.</li>
										<li>Power and energy management: Self-balancing robots typically require a significant
											amount of power to operate, especially if they are equipped with motors or actuators that
											control their movement. This can be a challenge, especially if the robot is required to
											operate for extended periods of time.</li>	
										<li>Robustness and reliability: Self-balancing robots must be able to operate reliably in a
											variety of conditions and environments. This requires careful design and testing to ensure
											that the robot is able to withstand the forces it will encounter, and that it can recover from
											unexpected events such as falls or collisions.</li>	
										<li>Human-robot interaction: If a self-balancing robot is intended for use by humans, it must
											be designed with safety and usability in mind. This includes considerations such as the
											size and shape of the robot, as well as the methods it uses to interact with humans.</li>
										<li>Cost and scalability: Self-balancing robots can be expensive to design and build,
											especially if they are equipped with advanced sensors and control systems. This can be a
											challenge, especially if the robot is intended for use in a consumer market.</li>	
									</ol>
									<p>For the project, due to the given time constraint the primary concern is ensuring that the<strong> robot is
										able to maintain its balance while navigating over the provided terrain, without falling </strong>and
										shaking much. This requires the robot to have a high level of stability and to be able to quickly
										and accurately respond to feedback from its environment.</p>
