								<p>Agricultural quadcopters have revolutionized the agricultural sector by offering farmers enhanced efficiency, major cost savings and more profitability. The major challenge that farmers face is the loss of produce due to plant diseases. Late detection of plant diseases doesn’t leave time for remedial actions.</p>
								<p>Our Project, Image-Processing based Leaf disease detection using a Quadcopter provides an effective method for early detection of plant diseases by carrying out image-processing on leaf images which are captured by a mini-sized quadcopter</p>

								<span class="image main"><center><img src="images/thumbs/Project_2_0.jpg.png.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></center></span>
								<p>With a growing trend in consumption and a stark trend in the production of plant/crop-based food in
									India, the Agro-industry is in desperate need of restructuring the process of harvesting edible
									crops/plants. This project aims on developing a device/system that performs the important task of
									acquiring crucial data that determines if a plant is infected by analyzing the image of the leaf of a
									plant. This process is to be carried out by an AGV that is capable of navigating itself through a
									contained environment, and providing real-time big data to a farmer so he or she can take
									precautious action to protect his/her plants/crops. The project also involves integrating a 3-DOF
									robotic arm that is mounted on the AGV body. The arm's primary function is to guide the imagecapturing
									device to a leaf, but apart from that, the arm is also modular thereby giving us a chance to
									increase its functionality. Such a device would provide a farmer with much-needed analytics and
									decrease the laborious task of inspection.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Project objective</h3>
								<p> primary objective of this project is to build a device that is partially self-sufficient and
									capable of acquiring some crucial data from plants/crops. A device as stated above could
									help in minimising laborious inspection tasks and could help in increasing quality and yield
									of said plants/crops. Keeping this in mind certain sub-goals are set to design this system.
									First is to build a land based AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) which is partially selfsufficient,
									i.e., capable of analysing its surroundings and navigating itself through an
									undefined environment. Second is to build an Automated Image Capturing System capable
									of capturing, analysing and providing a conclusion based on the input. This system will
									primarily detect diseases on a leaf. Third is to build a Robotic Arm which solves the primary
									purpose of housing the Camera and guiding the camera to acquire accurate images. An
									effort will also be made to make this arm modular thereby increasing its functionality. On
									the whole this project primarily focuses on acquiring and analysing critical data thereby
									providing useful information to farmers</p>
